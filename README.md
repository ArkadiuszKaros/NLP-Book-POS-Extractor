# NLP Book POS Extractor

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting sentences from the text of two popular book series: *Harry Potter* and *Game of Thrones*. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques powered by [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), the project aims to identify and analyze the parts of speech (POS) for each word in a sentence.

## Data Sources
The text data is sourced from the following publicly available datasets on Kaggle:
- **Harry Potter Books**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammaindola/harry-potter-books)
- **Game of Thrones Books**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/game-of-thrones-book-dataset)

## Project Features
- Extracts sentences from the books.
- Processes each sentence using spaCy to identify parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.).
- Supports multiple NLP models for POS tagging.
- Potential use for language learning, text-based games, or further linguistic analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Sentence Extraction**: The script reads the text files of both series and extracts individual sentences.
2. **POS Tagging**: Each sentence is processed with spaCy to identify various parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more.
